**Problem Definition:**  The problem is to build an AI-powered diabetes prediction system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. The system aims to provide early risk assessment and personalized preventive measures, allowing individuals to take proactive actions to manage their health.

**Design Thinking:**

Data Collection: We need a dataset containing medical features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., along with information about whether the individual has diabetes or not.

Data Preprocessing: The medical data needs to be cleaned, normalized, and prepared for training machine learning models.

Feature Selection: We will select relevant features that can impact diabetes risk prediction.

Model Selection: We can experiment with various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation: We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Iterative Improvement: We will fine-tune the model parameters and explore techniques like feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Phase 2: Innovation**

In this phase, we'll explore innovative techniques and approaches to building our AI Based Diabetes Prediction System.

One innovative technique we can explore is using various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**Phase 3: Development**

In this phase, we'll start building the core components of our Diabetes Prediction System.

**Phase 4: Development**

In this phase, we'll continue building our Diabetes Prediction System by selecting a machine learning algorithm, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

**Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission**

In this phase, we'll document the entire project and prepare it for submission
